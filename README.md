#💬 Mental Health Chatbot using NLP
This project is an interactive, AI-powered mental health chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Streamlit. It aims to provide a supportive space for users to express their emotions, receive empathetic responses, and raise awareness about mental well-being.

🧠 Overview
Mental health challenges like anxiety, depression, and emotional distress are increasing globally. This chatbot project leverages the power of NLP to detect users’ emotional states through text input and provide thoughtful, non-judgmental support. It is not a replacement for therapy but serves as a bridge to encourage users to reflect and seek help when necessary.
